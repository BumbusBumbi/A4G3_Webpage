Project Requirements

Project Document: Besides your finished project as stored in your team's Github repo, you must also work together as a team on a shared project document that will provide a point of contact for your team members as well as information and resources.

Work Log: Your project document must include notes from each team member at the bottom of the document identifying what was done, how long it took each and every time work is done on the project.  Here's an example notation:

2/12/2016: (Bill) Researched genesis of UNIX at Bell Labs.  Linked potential resources on project document.  (.5 hours)

Each member should place the most recent work at the top so that each work log entry descends in chronological order. 

Work on Branches and use Pull Requests: Multiple branches and developers working on the project IS NOT a requirement. IF only one developer is working on the code you do not need branches (though branching/pull requests are recommended regardless). If multiple developers are working on the project, all work should be done on branches and should be followed by a pull request. Consider having one or more persons in your group be in charge of approving pull requests and merging.
