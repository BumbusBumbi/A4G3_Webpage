		<p>The common tree frog can be found in most areas of France except the south. It makes use of a large range of habitats where it rarely descends to the ground as it tends to spend its time in bushes and small trees where its presence is often made evident by its loud singing.</p>
		<p>This is more rapid than the stripeless and can be heard from April until early summer and again at the end of summer into autumn. Average size is about 4cm with a maximum of 5cm.</p>
		<p>Generally nocturnal, but not exclusively, it eats insects which it catches with its projectile tongue, these are often taken on the wing.</p>
		<p>It will frequently move into deep wells and other subterranean cavities when conditions are particularly hot or dry. Hibernation takes place from October until March, although it will remain active during periods of milder weather.</p>
